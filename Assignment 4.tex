\flushleft\section{\large\textbf{Disruptive innovation?}}

\large\flushleft disruptive innovation is innovation that creates a new market and value network or enters at the bottom of an existing market and eventually displaces established market-leading firms, products, and alliances.

\section{\large\textbf{Disruptive technology in healthcare}}

\large In the early 2000s, the healthcare industry was ripe for disruptive innovation. As Christensen and colleagues wrote in a 2000 article in the Harvard Business Review, “Health care delivery is convoluted, expensive, and often deeply dissatisfying to consumers.”\\

The authors said that a whole host of disruptive innovations could end the crisis – but only if entrenched powers got out of the way and let market forces play out.\\

“If the natural process of disruption is allowed to proceed,” they wrote, “we’ll be able to build a new system that’s characterized by lower costs, higher quality, and greater convenience than could ever be achieved under the old system.”\\

As predicted, we’ve seen dramatic changes due to disruptive technology in healthcare. Providers have adopted electronic health records, patients can view their records via online portals, and smartphones have changed the ways we access, deliver, and document care.\\

Still, it’s best to think of disruptive innovation as an ongoing process. The nature of technology means that new innovations are always shaking things up.\\

\flushleft\section{\centering\large\textbf{Example of disruptive healthcare technology}}

\large Disruption is happening everywhere in healthcare – from AI to mHealth to 3D printing and robotics. Here are a few contemporary examples of disruptive healthcare technology:\\
\begin{itemize}


\item Consumer devices, wearables and apps – In the past, patients could only get biometric data when they went to the doctor’s office. Now health data gathered from smartwatches and mobile fitness trackers allow consumers to play a new role in their health journey.\\
\item AI and machine learning – AI applications are everywhere in healthcare, from patient intake to predictive analytics to new drug develompment. This technology is changing how health systems operate and how care is delivered.\\
\item Telemedicine – COVID-19 accelerated the expansion of telemdicine, but with long-ranging impacts. Most patients say they are interested in virtual care going forward.\\
\item Blockchain – Blockchain is a database technology that stores data in a way that enhances security and usability. This innovation is changing many aspects of healthcare, including patient records, supply and distribution, and research.\\
These are just a few examples of technologies creating new markets and changing the way healthcare happen.
\end{itemize}
